1. Why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout ?
Because if you want to get anything from hard disk, setImmediate will first work than setTimeout.

2. Difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate ?
setImmediate will schedule a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after IO events callbacks.
process.nextTick is not part of event loop, it adds the callback into the nextTick queue.

3. Name 10 modules that Node provides by default?
url, require, global, http, http2, setTimeout, util, domain, process, setInterval
